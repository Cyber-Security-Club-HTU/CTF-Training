# Memory

You have this [memory dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/131SkdhbxkZe0VdjcX05DNB1YiT5g-ip-/view?usp=sharing). You have to find 5 flags. If you're stuck, you can find some hints [here](./hints.md)

### Flag 1

There's an image somewhere that includes a hidden flag, use your forensics and steganography skills to extract it.


### Flag 2 and 3

During the capture of the memory, there were 2 common processes open, try to get the flags from them.

### Flag 4

The computer owner is called Adin. Could you get his password? flag format is CSC{password}

### Flag 5

The user has installed a malware. The flag is the IP address of the website that Adin downloaded the malware from.

### Flag 6

This one is pretty hard. Try to reverse engineer the malware, and recover the flag in the desktop (the encrypted flag is in `flag` file).
