## Client/Server Architecture

Every website is hosted on a server that runs the main script of the website. So, whenever we request a webpage or a file, the browser sends a *request* to the server with some specific information. The server then analyzes the request, and then replies back with a *response* to the client server.

This communication process is described as a client/server architecture.

## GET / POST Request Methods

As said above, when we open a webpage, we make a request to the server. This request has a method that defines the behavior of the request, since each method has its own usage and characteristics. Those can be one of many available, **which include:**

#### GET Requests

- **Usage:** When we request a specific resource to be rendered or downloaded. Example: `https://example.com/menu` .

- **Parameters display:** It is sent through (key=value) pair. We write the `?` symbol to tell the browser that the next are parameters. Example: `https://example.com/menu?color=blue` .

- **Notes:**
	- Use `&` symbol for multiple parameters. Example: `https://example.com/menu?color=blue&size=big` .
	- There is a length limitation.
	- The GET requests body is only written in the URL.

#### POST Requests

- **Usage:** When we want to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

- **Parameters display:** It is sent through the *request body* as a (key=value) pairs.

- **Notes:**
	- Use `&` symbol for multiple parameters. Example: `color=blue&size=big` .
	- You can send the data in multiple forms, such as: JSON, plaintext, or file.

## HTTP Headers

HTTP requests consist of a header and body. The body is used in POST requests to send the data. While the HTTP headers let you exchange more information regarding the request and the response sent between the client and the server.

- It is in this format: `Referer: https://example.com/` .

- The header name isn't case-sensitive.

- Make a space between the `:` and the value.

- You can add or remove headers as you want, unless it is required by the server.

**Some need-to-know *client-side* (request) headers:**

- **`Host` :** The domain name of the website you are requesting. Example: `Host: example.com` .

- **`User-Agent` :** It is a string that helps the server identify your browser OS, vendor, etc. You can put your name if you want. Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.82 Safari/537.36` .

- **`Referer` :** It is the URL that this request is initiated from. In anther way, the website you are currency in, before requesting the new one. `Referer: https://example.com/` .

- **`Content-Type` :** It has a standard format. It is used to define what kind of data it is sending in its body. Possible values: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain` .

- **`Cookie` :** It shares your cookie values in the current session.

**Some need-to-know *server-side* (response) headers:**

- **`Set-Cookie` :** It sets a key-value pair of cookie data to the client user-agent. Any further request will have this cookie with it.

- **`Server` :** It describes the software used by the origin server that handled the request — that is, the server that generated the response.

- **`X-Powered-By` :** It describes the technologies used by the web server.

- **`Location` :** It is used in redirections. It describes the website URL to be redirected to.

## URL-Encoding

When we type a website URL and search for it, the *browser* behind the scenes convert this URL into percentage-like characters through encoding.

- Its purpose is to make the data in a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.

- The server will decode it on its side, so the server is okay with this encoding, it accepts it.

- You can open URL-encoded links normally from the link bar.

- Spaces are not allowed in the URL. Replace them with either: `+`  sign or `%20` .

*Example:*

```

Before: https://myshop.com/menu?color=Dark Blue&size=big

After: https%3A%2F%2Fmyshop.com%2Fmenu%3Fcolor%3DDark%20Blue%26size%3Dbig

```

>URL encoding is utilized to bypass some restrictions on certain characters.

## cURL

- `curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data specified with URL syntax. 
- It is a built-in binary preinstalled in Unix systems.
- We use it for many things: like making HTTP `GET` or `POST` requests from the terminal.

**Here are the basic syntax for them:**

**`GET` request:**
```shell
curl http://example.com
```

**`POST` request:**
```shell
curl -XPOST http://example.com
```

**To get *response* headers:**
```shell
curl https://example.com -I
```

**To request with headers:**
```shell
curl https://example.com -H "User-Agent: Superman" -H "Host: 127.0.0.1"
```

**To `POST` with data:**
```shell
curl -XPOST https://example.com -H "Referer: https://google.com" -d "name=mike&color=blue"
```

```shell
curl -XPOST https://example.com -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Id": 79, "status": 3}'
```

**To request with *cookie*:**
```shell
curl https://example.com -H "Referer: https://google.com" -b "session=knafa123"
```


>You can always refer to the `man` page for any tool documentation by running this in your terminal : `man curl`. Or you can also check it online.

## Developer Tools

It is a set of tools that can be used for various reasons such as: development, debugging, and website inspection. Each browser has these tools, and they differ a bit in the layout, but the functionality is almost the same.

##### These below are some of the options available in Firefox:

- **`Inspector`:** View, edit, and delete HTML elements.

- **`Console`:** Run JavaScript code and query the elements of the webpage.

- **`Debugger`:** It shows the file structure on the server. You can view all the files.

- **`Network`:** It shows the requested files and their status codes. Click on any of them to see the request and response headers sent.

>"*View Page Source*" option when you do `right click`, displays the HTML standard content in a better way.
