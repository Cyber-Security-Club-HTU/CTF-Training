# Broken Access Control (IDOR)


## About

*Direct Object Reference* is an identifier for some resource on the webserver. The application uses this identifier to do some action based on its value. Identifiers could be:
- An endpoint. Example: `https://example.org/users/123` .
- A `GET` parameter. Example: `https://example.org/users/id=55` .
- `POST` request body. Example: a value of the used id could be sent through a form.

## The Vulnerability

If a website isn't configured and doesn't handle object referencing properly, an attacker can simply change the value for these attributes, which will grant him access to read, write, modify, or even delete data that he hasn't any authorization to access. 

***Example:***

We have a web that improperly configured app that has a list of accounts stored in its database. It deletes an account based on a `GET` parameter named `id` passed to the endpoint `delete` as shown below:

| **id** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **name** | mike | john | sara | alice |

To delete mike's account, we would request this URL:
```
https://library.com/users/delete.php?id=1`
```

If we change the `id` parameter to `4`, we can delete the user account for `alice`, even if we are not signed-in as *Alice*.
