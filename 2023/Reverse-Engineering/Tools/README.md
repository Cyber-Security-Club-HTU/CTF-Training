# Reverse Engineering Tools

**Welcome to the dynamic world of Reverse Engineering in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges! If you're a beginner, you might be wondering what reverse engineering is.**

At its core, reverse engineering is the process of understanding and dissecting software, usually binaries, to uncover its internal workings or to find vulnerabilities. 

**In the context of CTFs, your primary goal is often to retrieve a hidden message or "flag" embedded within software or to understand how a program functions to exploit it.**

```
Most of the time your aim is to get a flag, but some challenges gives you a link or a clue for another challenge
(which is a completion of the first challenge) that will have the flag.
```

Now, diving straight into a binary without any tools would be like trying to read a book in the dark. To save time and work efficiently, we rely on a suite of specialized tools. 

These tools won't do the work for you, but they will shine a light on the code, making your task much more manageable. Remember, the end goal is to find the flag, and these tools, when used correctly, can significantly speed up that process.

```
Here are some of the fundamental tools categories that can help you:
```

- **Disassemblers:** These break down binary files (executables) into assembly code, making it readable and easier to understand. Examples include IDA Pro and Ghidra.
- **Debuggers:** They allow you to pause, inspect, and manipulate a running program, essential for understanding how software works and for identifying vulnerabilities. Popular choices are GDB and OllyDbg.
- **Hex Editors:** These are used to view and modify the binary data of a file directly. Tools like HxD or Hex Fiend come in handy.
- **String Extractors:** Often, binaries contain readable strings that can provide hints or even direct answers. The 'strings' command on Linux is a simple yet effective tool for this.
- **Decompilers:** These attempt to translate binary files back into high-level source code. Ghidra and IDA Pro come with decompiler functionalities.
- **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Tools like strace and ltrace on Linux can trace system calls made by a program, which can be instrumental in understanding its behavior.
- **Scripting and Automation:** Sometimes, repetitive tasks can be automated using scripting languages like Python. Tools like pwntools can aid in this.

## Let's Start

**Before you begin, it's essential to note that the tools and techniques mentioned here are primarily focused on reversing ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) Linux binaries.**

**It won't cover EXE (Windows) or JVM-based binaries. It's highly recommended to use a Linux distribution such as Kali for these tasks.**

**If you find that any tool is missing, you can easily install it using:**

\`\`\`
sudo apt install <tool-name>
\`\`\`

**Now, let's delve into some of the fundamental tools:**

### 1. Strings
The 'strings' command extracts readable character sequences from binary files. It's a quick way to find hints or potential flags.
Usage:
\`\`\`
strings <binary-name>
\`\`\`

### 2. ltrace

'ltrace' intercepts and records dynamic library calls made by a binary and the signals received by it. 

Usage:
\`\`\`
ltrace ./<binary-name>
\`\`\`

### 3. strace

'strace' traces system calls and signals. It's useful for understanding the interactions of a binary with the operating system.

Usage:
\`\`\`
strace ./<binary-name>
\`\`\`

### 4. readelf

'readelf' displays information about ELF files, including headers, sections, and symbols.

Usage:
\`\`\`
readelf -a <binary-name>
\`\`\`

### 5. gdb

The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a powerful debugger for ELF binaries. It allows you to inspect, run, and modify running programs.
Usage:

\`\`\`
gdb ./<binary-name>
\`\`\`

### 6. Ghidra

Ghidra is both a disassembler and a decompiler. While not run directly from the command line like the other tools, Ghidra provides an extensive GUI for analyzing binaries in-depth.

### 7. objdump

'objdump' provides a variety of information about object files, including their structure, symbols, and assembly code.

Usage:
\`\`\`
objdump -D <binary-name>
\`\`\`
