# ColdRoot CTF Challenges

Welcome to the ColdRoot CTF challenges. Dive deep into the world of ColdRoot, a Russian APT group, and uncover their hidden secrets.

## Challenge 1: Frozen Byte

### Scenario
A large multinational corporation recently suffered a data breach. Initial findings suggest that the breach was orchestrated by a Russian APT group, "ColdRoot". A suspicious binary was found on one of the compromised systems. Analysis of this binary may yield clues about the group's intentions and perhaps reveal some of their hidden infrastructure.

### Objective
Analyze the provided binary to uncover hidden secrets.

### Hints
- Sometimes, it's not about gaining access but understanding the process.
- Strings might help, but remember, they can be deceiving.

### Tools Suggested
- `file`
- `strings`
- `strace`
- `ltrace`
- `objdump`
- `readelf`
- `ghidra`

## Challenge 2: Siberian Decode

### Scenario
After navigating the ColdRoot Systems, you stumble upon another binary. This one seems to contain encrypted data. Initial static analysis shows there are color-based references in the binary. Further investigation is needed to uncover its secrets.

### Objective
Decrypt the hidden message within the binary using dynamic analysis.

### Hint
The path ahead requires a trio of colors. Look to the north, where winters are long, and tales are told of bear and babushka.

### Tools Suggested
- `gdb`
- `ghidra`
- `objdump`
- `radare2`


***Good luck to all participants and may the best hacker win!***
