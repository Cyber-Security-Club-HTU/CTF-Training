# Welcome To Cryptography Section


This repository contains some practical essential fundamental concepts to know when doing cryptography challenges in CTF competitions. Cryptography is a standalone science, so it is impossible to conclude everything in couple of lessons. So, we tried to cover as much important topics as possible to build a solid foundation, that enables you to continue the journey yourself and explore it more.
